ASHES OF BRINKWOOD 
 Brinkwood happens to be one of the many towns within the kingdom of 
eldoria. Located south-west of the main capital, Brinkwood is a lively town that 
welcomes all into its land. 
 Although over many years there have been strange reports coming from 
Brinkwood and one of which is the disappearance of children during a festival. 
 Brinkwood often holds a festival each year of the royal calendar to celebrate 
the town yearly harvest and prosperity, people from far often come the witness the 
joy and festivity the event brings. But every year there is always a report of 
missing children, action and investigation measures has been taken but no lead was 
found. 
 The Eldorian knights declared it as basic kidnapping as big festivals can 
often attract slave merchants, they also took multiple precautions like setting up 
guards and patrol but still they found nothing. This undoubtedly reduced the 
number of missing children but the event still occurred. 
 The festival was placed on hold for five years for further investigation but 
still they found nothing. After five years the festival was finally going to be held 
once more and everyone wis looking forward to it. 
 An anonymous request was placed for an adventurer to pose as a civilian and 
investigate on the matter concerning the disappearance of children that attend the 
festival although this isn’t the first time this particular request was sent to the 
guild, anytime such request was answered it usually result in nothing being found 
of the disappearance of the summoned adventurer which in on itself Is suspicious. 
 Now another request has been sent hinting again that the people of the 
village at least those in control could be the reasons of the disappearance of these 
children, as unrealistic as it sounds and thus without evidence, it’s better than 
having nothing to work with. 
 You have been called to look into the matter at hand and travel to Brinkwood 
and investigate before the five-day festival ends.
