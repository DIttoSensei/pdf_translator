Brinkwood is a town in the kingdom of Eldoria, known for its lively festivals and welcoming atmosphere. However, the town has a dark history of children disappearing during the annual harvest festival. Despite investigations by the Eldorian knights, no leads were found and the disappearances continued. The festival was even put on hold for five years, but the problem persisted. An anonymous request has been made to a guild of adventurers to investigate the disappearances, but past attempts to do so have resulted in the disappearance of the adventurers themselves, raising further suspicion.
