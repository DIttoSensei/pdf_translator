The story begins with the narrator remembering their past, fragmented memories of battles fought and loved ones lost. They recall the voice of the Radiant Dawn, which spoke of the ancient past and lost history. The narrator learns about the birth of the realm, where chaotic energy transformed into the first lights, marking a new era. 

The first three millennia, known as the Aethereal Dawn, brought harmony and balance to the realm. However, the fourth millennium was marked by cataclysmic events, including Terra Ascensa, Ignis Eximius, and Gelus Aeternum, which reshaped the world. The fifth millennium saw the formation of Tempestas Aeterna, unrelenting storms, and the birth of The Aetherspire. 

The Aetherspire calmed the aetheric energies, but its presence also awakened Nether, a dormant counterpart to Aether. Nether's introduction to the realm caused chaos, but it eventually balanced with Aether, creating a new harmony. The Kyrexi Ascension, a localized phenomenon, expanded and merged with the Aetherspire, creating a twin focal point. The realm's energies reached a critical juncture, poised on the threshold of a new era.
